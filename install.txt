INSTALLATION NOTES

To install the Webduino web server library into your Arduino IDE, copy
the Wedduino folder to your .../arduino-<ver>/hardware/libraries
folder.  The example sketches in the "Examples" folder can just be
copied into your personal sketchbook folder.

If you get an error message when building the examples similar to
"WebServer.h not found", it's a problem with where you put the
Webduino folder.  The server won't work if the header is directly in
the libraries folder.
